## General Info
* Create a report that gives aggregate monthly statistics on employer accounts and their superannuation payments, per month and per “employer tier”.

## Report Info
The report takes the form of a table, with the following columns:
* Tier – the employer tier (i.e. segmentation category) of this row
* Month end date – the end date for the month of this row
* Num payments – the total number of superannuation contributions paid for this month/tier
* Amount of payments – the total amount of superannuation contributions paid for this month/tier
* New employers – newly open employer accounts introduced within this month at this tier
* Open employers at EOM (end of month) – number of employer accounts open at the month end date at this tier
* The report is to cover January 2018 to December 2018 and ordered by “Tier” and “Month end date”.

## Delivery
